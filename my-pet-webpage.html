  <h1>Niki and Jake</h1>
  <p>
      When I was a kid, my family had two golden retrievers named Niki and Jake. Niki was yellow and had wavy medium-length hair. Jake was the runt of his litter and had red-brown, curly hair. Jake loved to play fetch, to the point where he would push the ball under furniture to play with himself, if nobody wanted to throw it for him. Niki, on the other hand, preferred to keep the ball and run away - she didn't like returning it. Niki was a compulsive eater, and would eat everything you put down for her. Jake would eat only when he was hungry.
